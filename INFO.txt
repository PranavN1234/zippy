Project: In-Memory Data Store (Redis-like Tool)
Project Description:
Develop a lightweight, in-memory data store similar to Redis that supports key-value storage with additional features like data persistence, basic data structures (e.g., lists, sets, hashes), and possibly simple pub/sub messaging.

Key Features:

In-Memory Storage:

Implement efficient key-value storage using hash tables.
Support basic data types (strings, lists, sets, hashes).
Data Persistence:

Implement snapshotting (saving the in-memory data to disk at intervals).
Support for append-only file (AOF) logging to ensure data durability.
Basic Commands:

CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
Support for atomic operations and transactions (e.g., MULTI/EXEC in Redis).
Networking:

Implement a simple server that listens for client connections using sockets.
Support a simple protocol for client-server communication.
Concurrency:

Handle multiple clients concurrently using multi-threading or an event loop (e.g., using epoll or select).
Optional Features:

Implement simple pub/sub messaging.
Add data expiration and eviction policies.
Basic clustering or replication for fault tolerance.
Skills Highlighted:
System Design: Demonstrates ability to design and implement a complex system from scratch.
Data Structures: Showcases knowledge of advanced data structures like hash tables, lists, sets, and more.
Concurrency: Highlights proficiency in multi-threading and concurrent programming.
Networking: Shows experience with socket programming and client-server architecture.
Performance Optimization: Demonstrates the ability to write efficient, high-performance code.
Persistence and Durability: Shows knowledge of file I/O and techniques for ensuring data durability.
Pros:
Highly impressive project that touches on many advanced and valuable topics in computer science.
Demonstrates a wide range of skills that are highly relevant for many software engineering roles.
Provides a solid understanding of how modern in-memory databases work, which is beneficial for backend and system development positions.
Cons:
High complexity and may require more time than a week, depending on the features implemented.
Requires a solid understanding of various advanced topics, which might be challenging within a tight timeframe.
Implementation Steps:
Initial Setup:

Set up the project structure and basic build system.
Define the core classes and data structures.
Basic Key-Value Store:

Implement a basic hash table for in-memory key-value storage.
Develop basic CRUD operations and a simple command parser.
Networking:

Set up a basic server to handle client connections and requests.
Implement a simple text-based protocol for client-server communication.
Concurrency:

Add support for handling multiple client connections concurrently using threading or an event-driven approach.
Persistence:

Implement snapshotting to save the in-memory state to disk.
Add support for AOF logging to ensure data durability.
Additional Features:

Implement additional data structures (lists, sets, hashes).
Add support for atomic operations and transactions.
Implement optional features like pub/sub, data expiration, and simple clustering.
Conclusion:
Building a Redis-like in-memory data store in C++ is an ambitious and impressive project that can significantly boost your resume. It demonstrates a wide array of valuable skills and provides a deep understanding of system-level programming. While challenging, it is a highly rewarding project that can set you apart from other candidates in software engineering roles. If you decide to pursue this project, be sure to scope it appropriately to fit within your timeframe, focusing on core functionalities first and then adding additional features as time permits.



=================


Creating a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for an in-memory data store similar to Redis involves focusing on the core functionalities first. Given that you have one week and two developers, it's crucial to prioritize the most essential features. Here's a step-by-step plan to get an MVP running as quickly as possible:

Day 1-2: Initial Setup and Basic Key-Value Store
Project Setup:

Set up the project repository and build system (CMake, Makefile, etc.).
Create the basic directory structure (src, include, tests).
Core Classes and Data Structures:

Define the main classes (e.g., Server, Database, ClientHandler).
Implement a basic in-memory hash table for storing key-value pairs.
Basic CRUD Operations:

Implement functions for SET, GET, DELETE operations.
Write basic unit tests to ensure the CRUD operations work correctly.
Day 3: Networking and Client Handling
Simple Server:

Implement a TCP server that listens for client connections.
Use sockets for communication (consider using libraries like Boost.Asio for easier networking).
Command Parser:

Implement a simple parser to handle incoming commands from clients.
Connect the parser to the CRUD operations in the Database class.
Day 4: Concurrency and Multi-Client Support
Concurrency Handling:
Implement basic multi-threading to handle multiple clients concurrently (e.g., using std::thread or thread pool).
Ensure thread-safe access to the in-memory store (use mutexes or other synchronization primitives).
Day 5: Persistence (Basic Snapshotting)
Snapshotting:
Implement a simple mechanism to save the in-memory data to disk at regular intervals.
Ensure that the data can be loaded back into memory on startup.
Day 6: Testing and Optimization
Testing:

Conduct integration tests to ensure that the server handles multiple clients and commands correctly.
Test the persistence feature to ensure data integrity.
Optimization:

Profile the application to identify and optimize any performance bottlenecks.
Improve the efficiency of data structures and network handling if necessary.
Day 7: Documentation and Final Touches
Documentation:

Write clear documentation for setting up, running, and using the MVP.
Document the code to make it easy to understand and maintain.
Final Testing and Polishing:

Perform final tests to ensure everything works as expected.
Fix any bugs and make final adjustments to improve usability and performance.
Key Deliverables for the MVP:
Core Functionalities:

In-memory key-value storage with SET, GET, DELETE operations.
Basic TCP server to handle client connections and commands.
Simple multi-threading to support multiple clients.
Basic data persistence through snapshotting.
Documentation:

Instructions for building and running the server.
Basic usage guide for clients to interact with the server.
